# Regression Project 

This folder contains two files: 

1. LifeExpectancyData.csv - This is the data set for the regression model.

2. LifeExpectancy_RegressionModel.ipynb - This is the python notebook that contains the machine learning model.

In this project, the life expectancy of various countries has been predicted using Random Forest Regression. The data set consists of various attributes of the countries such as GDP, adult mortality, BMI, population and statistics of different diseases like polio, HIV, measles, etc.


# Classification Project 1

This folder contains two files:

1. diabetes.csv - This is the dataset for the classification model.

2. Diabetes_Logistic_ClassificationModel.ipynb - This is the python notebook that contains the machine learning model.

The data set consists of various medical predictors of women like BMI, age, blood pressure etc. The machine learning model uses logistic regression to classify patients in the dataset as diabetic or not.


# Classification Project 2

This folder contains 4 files:

1. train.csv - This is the training data set of the classification model.

2. test.csv - This is the test data set for the classification model.

3. Term Deposit Subscription Prediction.ipynb - This is the python notebook that contains the machine learning model.

4. submission_final.csv - This is the CSV file that contains the customer id along with its subscription prediction from the machine learning model.

Train and test data set has client data such as : age of the client, their job type, their marital status, etc. of a retail banking institution. After statistical data analysis of both the data sets, two classification models - Logistic Regression and Decision Tree are applied to classify whether the new clients in the test data set will subscribe to the term deposit or not. The evaluation metric used to figure out the best one is accuracy. 

This project was done during the Data Science Training provided by Internshala Trainings.
